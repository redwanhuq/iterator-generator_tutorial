# Guides for implementing iterators and generators in Python
This repo contains the Jupyter iPython notebooks (Anaconda distribution) used to build the associated blog posts:
- [Iterables, iterators and generators, oh my! Part 1](http://machinemadephd.com/posts/understanding-iterators/) focuses on iterable, iterators and the iterator protocol
- [Iterables, iterators and generators, oh my! Part 2](http://machinemadephd.com/posts/understanding-generators/) focuses on generators, generator functions and generator expressions
